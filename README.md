# Bus-simulator

# Instructions
  - run Main.java, # of buses/starting positions/ of buses can be varied in Main. Run-time of simulation is 
    also varied in Main. Inter-arrival rate can be varied in RiderEvent.java

# Overview: 
  - Events simulated bus/rider actions, and were rescheduled and ran through the agenda until the simulated time was up.

# Data structures:
  - queue and stack // complicated algorithms are explained through comments in each class.
  - queue: A queue was a good idea to use because it simulates any kind of line. (FIFO)
  - Stack: I used a stack in RiderEvent because it is automatically resized with convenient push/pop methods.
           It's also easy to add to and remove from therefore it was a good idea to use this for temporary storage.

# Bugs/known issues: 
  - None known

# Other:
  - Bus simulator.pdf details the findings of this project
